# SimpleUPnP

A very simple UPnP browser, aimed at music playback on Chromecast.

This app is deliberately simple and targeted to my specific use-case - browsing
a UPnP server and sending either individual MP3 files or entire folders to a
Chromecast Audio for playback. Your mileage may vary. In particular, this app
makes at least the following assumptions:

  * All non-containers found on the UPnP server are music files.
  * All music files are MP3.
